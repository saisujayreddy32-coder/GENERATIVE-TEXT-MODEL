# This project implements a text generation system using a pre-trained language model (GPT-2) to generate coherent and contextually relevant paragraphs based on user-provided prompts. The system accepts a topic or starting sentence as input and produces meaningful text that continues the idea in natural language.The implementation leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides access to powerful pre-trained models trained on large-scale text data. By using GPT-2, the model is able to understand context and generate fluent text without requiring manual training.

# Tools Used

# Python – Programming language used for implementation

# Hugging Face Transformers – Library used for loading and running the text generation model

# Pre-trained Model (GPT-2) – Used to generate coherent text based on user prompts

# PyTorch – Backend deep learning framework used by the Transformers library

# Google Colab – Cloud-based environment used to write, run, and test the code
